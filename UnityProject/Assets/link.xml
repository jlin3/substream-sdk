    IL2CPP Code Stripping Prevention for Unity WebRTC Streaming
    
    This file prevents IL2CPP from stripping Unity.RenderStreaming and Unity.WebRTC
    assemblies during builds. Required because RenderStreamControl.cs uses reflection
    to call WebRTC APIs for Unity 2022.3 compatibility.
    
    Without this file, video streaming will fail on IL2CPP builds (Quest, iOS, etc)
    with "black screen" - audio works but video is stripped.
    
    Place this file at: Assets/link.xml in your Unity project root
  -->
  
  <assembly fullname="Unity.RenderStreaming" preserve="all"/>
  <assembly fullname="Unity.WebRTC" preserve="all"/>
