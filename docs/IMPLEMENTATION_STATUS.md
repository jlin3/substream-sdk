## How to Continue Development

### Running Backend Locally
```bash
cd WebappBackend
npm install
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost
```

### Testing APIs
```bash
# Get health status
curl http://localhost/health

# Test session API (need JWT first)
# Get JWT from your main app, then:
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/sessions/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"connectionId": "test"}'
```

### Deploying to Railway
```bash
# Push to main branch
git push origin main

# Railway auto-deploys
# Check deployment at: https://railway.app
```

## Questions to Answer

1. **Main App JWT Secret**: What JWT secret does your main app use?
2. **Parent Email**: How do we get parent email from user ID?
3. **Stream Viewer URL**: What domain will host the viewer?
4. **AWS Account**: Do you have AWS account for S3?
5. **Twilio Account**: Do you have Twilio account?
