## üîß Technical Improvements

- [ ] **Connection Reliability**
  - [ ] Implement ICE restart on connection failure

  - [ ] Fallback to different TURN servers
  - [ ] Handle network transitions (WiFi ‚Üí cellular)

- [ ] **Performance**
  - [ ] Adaptive bitrate based on network conditions
  - [ ] H.264 hardware encoding (if available)
  - [ ] Client-side buffering optimization
  - [ ] Lazy loading for stream list

- [ ] **Unity Client**

  - [ ] Stream pause/resume
  - [ ] Bandwidth usage controls
  - [ ] Battery optimization
  - [ ] Stream quality presets
  - [ ] Automatic retry on connection failure

## üß™ Testing

- [ ] **Load Testing**
  - [ ] Test with 10+ concurrent streams
  - [ ] Test with 100+ concurrent viewers
  - [ ] Measure bandwidth costs
  - [ ] Identify bottlenecks

- [ ] **Network Conditions**
  - [ ] Test on 4G/5G mobile networks
  - [ ] Test with VPN
  - [ ] Test behind corporate firewall
  - [ ] Test with packet loss simulation
  - [ ] Test with high latency

- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**
  - [ ] Chrome (desktop & mobile)
  - [ ] Firefox
  - [ ] Safari (desktop & iOS)
  - [ ] Edge

## üí∞ Cost Estimation (Monthly)

### **Small Scale (10-50 concurrent streams)**
- TURN servers: $100-200
- Hosting (Railway/AWS): $50-100
- Database: $20-50
- Monitoring: $20-50
- **Total: ~$200-400/month**

### **Medium Scale (50-200 concurrent streams)**
- TURN servers: $300-500
- Hosting: $200-400
- Database: $100-200
- CDN: $50-100
- Monitoring: $50-100
- **Total: ~$700-1,300/month**

### **Large Scale (200+ concurrent streams)**
- Custom infrastructure needed
- Dedicated TURN servers
- Multi-region deployment
- **Total: $2,000+/month**

## üö® Critical Issues to Fix First

1. **TURN Servers** - Replace free ones immediately
2. **Authentication** - Anyone can stream/view currently
3. **Error Handling** - Better recovery from failures
4. **Monitoring** - Need visibility into what's happening
5. **Session Management** - Track who's streaming/viewing

## üìù Backend API Updates Needed

See `integration-example.md` for detailed API spec.

### **Minimum Required Endpoints:**
```
POST   /api/stream/session      - Create streaming session
POST   /api/stream/token        - Get auth token
GET    /api/stream/active       - List active streams
POST   /api/stream/join/:id     - Join as viewer
DELETE /api/stream/session/:id  - End streaming session
POST   /api/stream/heartbeat    - Keep session alive
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Recommendations

### **Current Architecture:**
```
Unity VR ‚Üí WSS ‚Üí Railway Server ‚Üí WSS ‚Üí Browser
```

### **Recommended Production Architecture:**
```
Unity VR ‚Üí WSS ‚Üí Load Balancer ‚Üí [Signaling Servers] ‚Üí Redis
                                          ‚Üì
                                    Browser Viewers
                                          ‚Üì
                                    TURN Servers
```

### **Components:**
1. **Load Balancer** (AWS ALB, Nginx)
2. **Multiple Signaling Servers** (Node.js instances)
3. **Redis** (Session storage & pub/sub)
4. **TURN Servers** (Coturn or managed service)
5. **Database** (PostgreSQL for persistence)
6. **Monitoring** (Datadog, CloudWatch)
7. **CDN** (CloudFront for static assets)

## üìö Next Steps
