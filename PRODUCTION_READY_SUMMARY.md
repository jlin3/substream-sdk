## üé¨ Demo Flow

Here's what the complete production flow looks like:

1. **Kid opens VR app on Quest**
   - App receives auth token from your main app
   - Token stored in PlayerPrefs

2. **Kid presses "Start Streaming" button**
   - Unity calls `POST /api/sessions/start` with auth token
   - Backend creates session in Supabase
   - Backend looks up parent email
   - Parent receives email: "Your child is streaming!"
   - Unity starts WebRTC connection

3. **Parent clicks link in email**
   - Opens `https://yourapp.com/watch/{sessionId}?token={parentToken}`
   - Your web app embeds the stream viewer
   - Viewer authenticates with JWT
   - Connects to WebRTC stream
   - **Recording starts automatically**

4. **Kid plays VR game**
   - Parent watches live 1080p stream
   - Multiple parents/friends can watch
   - Recording captures everything

5. **Kid stops streaming**
   - Unity calls `POST /api/sessions/end/{sessionId}`
   - Receiver stops recording
   - Recording chunks upload to S3
   - Backend combines chunks
   - Parent receives email: "Recording is ready!"

6. **Parent views recording**
   - Clicks link in email
   - Secure download from S3
   - Can share with family
